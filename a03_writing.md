The nature of academic writing (indeed writing in general), has the following components:

1. Sections to structure the paper or book itself
2. A series of headers and headings to structure the paper 
2. Paragraphs to tie the thoughts together
3. Diagrams and figures
4. Lists 
5. Tables
6. References
7. Ease of sharing with the world (preprint, or other servers)

## What Matters

## Platform independence

## Moving from Data Analysis to Tables and Text

## Ease of adding diagrams and figures

## Free and Open Source for transparency

## Bring on the citation support
