## The Art of writing 
The first step is easy: we layout a series of headings and build the structure. This should come from my sense of logic or the structure or my message to the world. I’d like to write in a nice structured way and would like that the world should read my work. I need a structure, and I need a distribution channel. The point is, what elements can we handle in plain text? Let’s see.

The idea is to see if we have tools and affordances that can enable me to write in plain text on a web browser and use the web mechanisms to bring in coworkers, or co-authors, and write a piece complete with bibliographic references and all elements easily, moving from situtaion and context to context yet missing nothing. Everything needs to be as easy as possible. Free, plain text is useful in the sense that people do not necessarily have to learn any crafty and clever tricks to get things to work. It is like using an email communication. You do not need to work in enhanced or rich text format, most of your simple text formatting options would enable you to work \cite{leonard2016text}

## Think in paragraphs
Writing in plain text does not matter when it comes to writing sentences and paragraphs. 

## Push bullets

## Add figures and graphs

## Adding citations and the power of bibtex

## Set it free

## What are the limitations of closed source tools?

## Why should we go open source?

## The power of Markdown

When XXX first designed markdown, it had to solve with his own frustration with the exsiting blogging system, and how difficult it was to put ideas coherently using simple plain text. That inconvenience pretty much remains the same today with so much knowledge work that we do. In most situations, we deal with data, and we tell stories with data. These are not easy in the sense that a lot of things are woven in between. We really need a tool that should take away the drudgery of finding the exact icon, and writing in a software that does not allow us or at least messes with the plain text nature of writing. That also means that if we have written anything in the form of a note somewhere using a notepad or say something like simplenote, now we cannot directly port that or use that as a starting point for writing a bigger piece. That short note must now be copied and pasted from its source to the computer we are working on. What if that source is on a webpage somewhere, and locked away? I therefore needed a system that was essentially web based, where I could write freely in plain text and yet I'd be able to produce everything in a coherent manner no matter where I worked. I'd like to be tethered to one device. 

This means, I start a paper in plain text in my office, develop an offline synchronisation, then come home or move to another machine running a different operating system, I can still access all of it in any way I want. The presentation of the text that I write can change. But that bit can be done later. The format of presentation has or should have nothing to do with the content of my thoughts. This in itself is a challenge.

- Analyse in R
- Write in markdown
- Present using Beamer
- Version control in Git
- How do we share and collaborate?
