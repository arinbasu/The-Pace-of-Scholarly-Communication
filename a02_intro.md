## The Promise of Plain Text Productivity for Academics

Kieran Healy (2015) in [an article on plain text productivity](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2014/01/23/plain-text/) for academics writes about two models for productivity -- one he cites as office model, where the academics stress on one document that gets written and commented and then submitted as a scholarly output. The engineering model, on the other hand is one, where the authors rely on the contents of the work and then using a series of plain text documents, keep sharing the work among the colleagues. This requires a body of the work to be maintained with robust version control but not so much dependence on the format or where the work gets written, or how. 

Over the years, I find myself moving away from specific constraints of software and more to write in plain text, and purpose the texts wherever I write. Part of it has to do with the flexibility of the work, but also because we now live in an age of technological development, where we can truly be free of the constraints of being tied to a particular device or an app. Plain text surprisingly makes us free of those constraints. 

In subsequent sections, I will lay out a plan of how I work using a combination of tools that can be chained to produce dynamic or at least readable scholarly documents. These tools are:

1. plain text or markdown for writing
2. a jupyter notebook for fine tuning the writing part
3. Jupyter notebook also helps in writing in a way to integrate data analysis
4. bibtex for reference management
5. using pandoc and git to control version control
6. using authorea (this) or [overleaf](http://www.overleaf.com) for final processing
