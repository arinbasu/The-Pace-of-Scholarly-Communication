## Summary

The purpose of this article is to explore the state of scholarly communication writing reproducible research entirely on the web. Specifically, really how easy it is? What is the exsiting workflow? How well do we connect to the way we should write our papers and our analyses? Also, how well are we integrated with the other devices and how well, indeed we can flexibly and collaboratively write the different segments? Where do we publish? How do we expedite reviews? Can we repurpose an article that we are writing for our other purposes, ie teaching and conference presentations? What solutions do we have at the moment?
